# Project Descriptions

**1. House Price Prediction**

This project uses a regression model to predict house prices based on property features. The model provides data-driven estimates to support real estate decisions.

- **Dataset:** Kaggle - Housing Prices (545 rows, 13 columns)

- **Key Features:** area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, furnishingstatus

- **Workflow:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Model Training (Regression), Evaluation (RMSE, RÂ²)

- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter/Colab

**2. Predictive Healthcare Diagnostics (EDA)**

This project explores a healthcare dataset to uncover insights into patient records, services, and outcomes.

- **Dataset:** Kaggle - Healthcare Dataset (5550 rows, 15 columns)

- **Key Features:** Age, Gender, Medical Condition, Admission Type, Medication, Test Results

- **Workflow:** Data Import, Cleaning, EDA (visualizations, trends, distributions)

- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter/Colab
